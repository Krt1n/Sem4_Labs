1. Retrieve the birth date and address of the employee(s) whose name is ‘John B. 
Smith’. Retrieve the name and address of all employees who work for the 
‘Research’ department.  

SELECT Bdate,Address FROM Employee WHERE Fname='John' AND Minit='B' and Lname='Smith';
SELECT E.Fname, E.Minit, E.Lname, E.Address FROM EMPLOYEE E JOIN DEPARTMENT D ON E.Dno = D.Dnumber WHERE D.Dname = 'Research';

2. For every project located in ‘Stanford’, list the project number, the controlling  
department number, and the department manager’s last name, address, and birth 
date. 

SELECT P.Pnumber,P.Dnum,E.Lname,E.Address,E.Bdate FROM PROJECT P JOIN Employee E on E.Dno=P.Dnum WHERE P.Plocation='Stanford';

3. For each employee, retrieve the employee’s first and last name and the first and 
last name of his or her immediate supervisor. 

SELECT E.Fname, E.Lname, S.Fname, S.Lname FROM Employee E LEFT JOIN Employee S ON E.Super_ssn=S.S
sn;

4. Make a list of all project numbers for projects that involve an employee whose 
last name is ‘Smith’, either as a worker or as a manager of the department that 
controls the project.  

SELECT DISTINCT P.Pnumber FROM Project P JOIN Works_On W ON P.Pnumber=W.Pno JOIN Employee E1 ON W
.Essn=E1.Ssn JOIN Department D ON P.Dnum = D.Dnumber JOIN Employee E2 ON D.Mgr_ssn = E2.Ssn WHERE E1.Lname = 'Smith' OR E2.Lname = 'Smith';

5. Show the resulting salaries if every employee working on the ‘ProductX’ project 
is given a 10 percent raise.  

SELECT E.Fname, E.Lname,
       E.Salary AS Original_Salary,
       E.Salary * 1.10 AS New_Salary
FROM Employee E
JOIN Works_On W ON E.Ssn = W.Essn
JOIN Project P ON W.Pno = P.Pnumber
WHERE P.Pname = 'ProductX';
